# Stock Market Price Prediction

This project is a **Stock Market Price Prediction W** developed as part of a mini-project in partial fulfillment for a Bachelor of Technology degree in Computer Science and Engineering. The project leverages machine learning algorithms like **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)** and **Regression** to predict stock prices using historical data.

---

## Introduction
The project aims to predict the future values of financial stocks using machine learning techniques like Regression and LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory). The database connection is handled using SQLite3, focusing on secure and efficient usage. The model predicts based on factors such as open, close, low, high, and volume data.
